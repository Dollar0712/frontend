# Prerequisites

1. Docker is required. It is recommended to install [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/).
2. Make sure port `5174` is not occupied on your machine (this port is used for the frontend dev server).

# Getting Started

In the `frontend` directory, run:
```sh
docker-compose up -d
```
